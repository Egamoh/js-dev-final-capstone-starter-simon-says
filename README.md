This is my final project, my capstone, to the Web Development Certificate course for the learning platform, Thinkful.
And what a ride it's been! I started out with a vague longing to be able to talk shop with those computer-savvy kids of today (the scamps), and ended up stubbornly committed to finishing this course to the bitter end. For people like me, this course *badly* needs to have appended to its name the words "boot-camp", or "deep-dive", or "months-long migraine" to it.
But here we are at the finish! I started out with nary an idea about what makes up a webpage, and now I present to you, this mundane, yet playable, Simon Says game, powered by javascript, held up by html, and garnished with a dab of CSS. Say what you will, this is not a bad start for someone that can remember keypunch cards.
